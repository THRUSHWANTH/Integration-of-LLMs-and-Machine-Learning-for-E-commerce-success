# Integration-of-LLMs-and-Machine-Learning-for-E-commerce-success
Integrating LLMs with Traditional recommendation models 

Traditional e-commerce recommendation systems often overlook valuable insights from item descriptions and user reviews, limiting their ability to provide truly personalized recommendations. 
Often users are overwhelmed by too many options. This leads to reduced relevance, missed sales opportunities, and ultimately, a diminished user experience.

**Objectives** : 
1. Enhanced understanding of user preferences through  Large language models and machine learning.
2. More personalized and relevant recommendations tailored to individual users, leading to increased engagement and sales.
3. Improved content-based filtering leveraging insights from item descriptions and user reviews.
4. Ultimately, integrating LLMs and machine learning in e-commerce leads to a superior user experience and increased business success.

**Methodology**:
Using RLMrec, a model-agnostic framework that involves collaborative profile generation and reasoning-driven system prompts, for improved personalized recommendations.
Implementing hybrid ranking for recommending top n recommendations.
